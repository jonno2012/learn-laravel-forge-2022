- youtube tute by larave guy, including how to setup deploy script: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzD7HI5lI1M

Configure server provider:
- For hetzner you will need an api key from hertzner

- You cannot install a managed DB when provisioning with Forge.
- Forge adds a default site when you add a server. You can access it by accessing the server's IP. It contains
instructions on how to setup sites etc.
- You might want to make sure the PHP version you are installing on the server is compatible with the Laravel version
you are using.

- There is a hidden default site which is there to drop any malicious requests to your server.

New Sites
--------
Aliases - typically used when running a multi-tenant application with a coiple of subdomains.
Project type - different laravel application types
Web directory - web root.
Allow Wildcard Sub-Domains - where users can create their own site and register their own subdomains as part of a multi-tenant
site.
Use Website isolation - Uses a separate FPM process. May be used if you want to allow user provided application code and
you want to mitigate the possibilty of maliciouse code being included. When using Webiste isolation, this would be run
on a separate process.
Create Database should be checked if you want to connect a db to a site automatically when using the Wordpress option
- When selecting 'App' as the site type, it  will create a database?? (not sure). You may have to select 'Web site' or whatever
it is called.It will also give you the option of installing wordpress and phpmyadmin if you select 'App'.
- You will need to create an A-record for your domain name to point the domain to the server's ip.
Generate Deploy Key - an advanced feature to be used when giving forge access to a specific repo which isn't owned by
connected repo.
- By default forge does a 'shallow clone' when cloning the repo for the first time meaning that you will not get the
full commit history.
- Forge will automatically create an ENV file vieable in the Environment tab.

Deployment
----------
- The forge variables are added to the deploy script to give deploy functionality. See forge docs for more info

Commands
--------
The 'Commands' tab shows a command line which can be used to run one of commands on the site. It could be used for things
like seeding DBs for example.
- Forge will mark a command as failed if it takes over 2 mins, even if it succeeds eventually.
